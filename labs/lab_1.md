### Huntington’s disease

Huntingtons disease is a late onset genetically inherited disease with symptoms relating to both physical and congitive decline, stemming from neurodegenrative decline. The related protein (Huntingtin) is not effected until late in the effected induviduals life (30+).

### Inheritance

Huntingtons disease is an autosomal dominant disorder. In practice this means that the aleles responsible for huntintons do not sit on the sex-deciding chromosomes (X/Y), and that as long as an indivudal has one "Dominant" alele on the gene, they have the disease.

For example, if parents A and B have the child C, and parent A has huntingtons,and parent B does not, there is a 50% chance that the child will have huntingtons

----- TODO ADD PAIR GRAPH THING YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN

Huntingtons sits on chromosome 4, assembly GRCh38. 

### Expression

Huntingtin is the protein effect by Huntingtons disease. Huntingtin includes a CAG repeat, usually of length 10-35, however the mutated protein has CAG repeats of length 36-120. Indivudials with CAG repeats of length 36-39 are more prone to, but do not always develop huntingtons disease. 

The CAG repeat leads to a larger, mutatet protein
