## 1. (7 points) Test your program with the following sample sequences and see if it can find all matches

### a. Example sequences

    AAAGCTCCGATCTCG and TAAAGCAATTTTGGTTTTTTTCCGA

**Found two optimal alignments:**

Score 5, indexes: 6,5     | CGAAA

Score 5, indexes: 25,10   | AGCCT

### b. Real life sequences

    The segment 7 sequence for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus
    (DNA_A_California_2009_pandemicH1N1_segment7.txt) and the coding
    region of the M2 gene from the Brisbane seasonal strain
    (DNA_A_Brisbane_2007_H1N1_M2_CDS.txt), both available from mittUiB

**Found one optimal alignment:**

Score 206, indexes: 294,994
